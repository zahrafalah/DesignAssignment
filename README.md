  @Description: In this assignment I implemented 5 design patterns: Facade, Bridge, Factory, Iterator, Builder.
  This is a GUI Based multi-user "Product  Trading  and  Bidding System (PTBS) program".
  The seller logs in and sets the products he wants to sell and then the users can log in and see the
  products available and will then click to buy. The result then will get stored in a text file called
  UserProduct.txt.
  The result is what the seller and users decided on and will get saved in the UserProduct.txt file.

  NOTE: To Run, Please make sure you change the path to the text files according to your
  computers paths in the FilePaths.java. Also, make sure before running the SellerList.txt and the
  UserProduct.txt (Duhh!!) is empty.
